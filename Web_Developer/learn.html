		<h2> The base element</h2>
		<p><img src="images/stickman.gif" width="24" height="39" alt="Stickman">
		- Notice that we have only specified a relative address for the image. Since we have specified a base URL in the head section, the browser will look for the image at "https://www.w3schools.com/images/stickman.gif".
		</p>
		
		<p><a href="tags/tag_base.asp">HTML base tag</a>
		- Notice that the link opens in a new window, even if it has no target="_blank" attribute. This is because the target attribute of the base element is set to "_blank".
